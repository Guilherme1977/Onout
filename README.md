### How to deploy
On domain is set autodeployment (see CF action)

Locally:
1. go to `src/scripts/`
2. run `updatePlugins.sh` and wait while plugins will be updated (for now only for GNU/Linux and OSX systems. Ask support if you have different system)
3. go back and run `npm run build`
6. copy everything from `build/`
